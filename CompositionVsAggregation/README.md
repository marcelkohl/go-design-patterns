# Composition

Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House.

Aggregation is a way of composing different abstractions together in defining a class. For example, a car class can be defined to contain other classes such as engine class, seat class, wheels class etc. Other examples of aggregation are: A window class containing menu class, check-box class etc.

## Composition vs Aggregation
https://treehozz.com/what-is-aggregation-and-composition-in-oop
The primary difference between aggregation and composition is that aggregation implicit a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. On the other hand, composition insinuates a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent.

In both aggregation and composition object of one class "owns" object of another class. But there is a subtle difference: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent.

In Short, a relationship between two objects is referred as an association, and an association is known as composition when one object owns other while an association is known as aggregation when one object uses another object.

Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House.

Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Example: Classroom (parent) and Student (child). Delete the Classroom and the Students still exist.

## Composition vs Inheritance

The composition is a design technique in which your class can have an instance of another class as a field of your class. Inheritance is a mechanism under which one object can acquire the properties and behavior of the parent object by extending a class.
