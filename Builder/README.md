# Builder Pattern
Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code

1. **Builder interface** declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.
2. **Concrete Builders** provide different implementations of the construction steps.
3. **Products** are the results from the builders. Different product's builders donâ€™t have to belong to the same class hierarchy or interface.
4. **Director** defines the sequence in which to call builder steps.

## Running
