# Factory Pattern
Factory pattern creates objects without exposing the creation to the client. The result refers to the created object using a common interface.

1. The client only interacts with a factory asking for the kind of objects needed.
2. The factory interacts with the corresponding concrete creator and returns back the correct object.
