# Prototype
Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned instead of the application being responsible to "copy" all the relevant attributes (public or private ones).

The prototype also may avoid the problem when an application "hard wires" the class of object to creation in each "new" expression.

1. The `Prototype interface` declares the cloning methods
2. In the implementation, in addition to copying the original objectâ€™s data to the clone, this method may also cover some specific edge cases of the cloning process like: linked objects, untangling recursive dependencies, etc.
